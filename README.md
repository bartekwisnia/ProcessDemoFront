# Process Demo Front

Front in React for Process Demo Project. Design Simulation and some informations about the owner

## Description

Process Demo project is a simple simulation of a process automation plant. User can design its plant/factory made of
tanks, pipes, valves etc. use prepared automated functions. The plant is simulates media flow, levels, temperatures,
pressure etc.

Project was done as a demo to my portfolio to show my programming skills and as I am an automation engineer I have
decided to do something that might be useful for me as well. I would like to use this project to explain my kids what
my work is all about and maybe inspire some softwarehouse to give me a chance in a role of a software developer.

This part is a frontend, it usind React and communicating through rest API with Django backend. Link to Django: https://github.com/bartekwisnia/ProcessDemoData
